# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

## Overview

This project, **0x06. Python - Classes and Objects**, delves into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. OOP is a fundamental paradigm in software development, and understanding it is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable code. Throughout this project, you'll learn about classes, objects, attributes, methods, encapsulation, and more.

## Project Description

- **Project Type**: Python
- **Topics**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance
- **Duration**: Apr 2, 2024, 6:00 AM - Apr 3, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Auto QA Review**: Scheduled at the deadline
- **Auto QA Score**: 0.0/77 mandatory & 0.0/63 optional (0.0% overall)
- **Learning Objectives**:
  - Understand the basics of Python programming and why Python is awesome.
  - Grasp the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), including classes, objects, and inheritance.
  - Explore the concepts of encapsulation, data abstraction, and information hiding.
  - Learn about attributes, methods, properties, and class vs. instance attributes.
  - Understand the purpose and usage of special methods like `__init__`.
  - Discover the Pythonic way to write getters and setters.
  - Gain insights into dynamic attribute creation and attribute binding.
  - Familiarize yourself with the `__dict__` attribute and attribute access mechanisms in Python.

## Requirements

- **Editor**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Platform**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Python Version**: 3.8.5
- **Coding Style**: PEP 8 (pycodestyle version 2.8.*)
- **Documentation**: All modules, classes, and functions should be properly documented.
- **Execution Permissions**: All files must be executable.
- **Documentation Standards**:
  - Modules: Each module should have a documentation header.
  - Classes: Each class should have a documentation header.
  - Functions: Each function (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation header.

## Tasks

1. **My first square**: Define an empty class `Square`.
2. **Square with size**: Define a class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size`.
3. **Size validation**: Extend the `Square` class with size validation.
4. **Area of a square**: Implement a method to calculate the area of a square.
5. **Access and update private attribute**: Implement getter and setter methods for the private attribute `size`.
6. **Printing a square**: Implement a method to print a square using the `#` character.
7. **Coordinates of a square**: Enhance the `Square` class to support a position attribute.
8. **Singly linked list**: Implement a singly linked list and a method for sorted insertion.
9. **Compare 2 squares**: Implement comparators for comparing squares based on their areas.
10. **ByteCode -> Python #5**: Write a Python class that matches a given Python bytecode.
