0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions
Description
The "0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions" project is part of the ALX High Level Programming curriculum. It focuses on enhancing your understanding and proficiency in Python programming, specifically in the areas of if/else statements, loops, and functions. The tasks cover a range of concepts, including conditional statements, loops, ASCII manipulation, and basic algorithm implementation.

Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple tasks, each residing in its own directory and focusing on a specific aspect of Python programming. Below is an overview of the tasks:

Task 0: Positive anything is better than negative nothing
A Python script that assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

Task 1: The last digit
A Python script that assigns a random signed number to a variable and prints the last digit of the number along with a specific message.

Task 2: I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
A Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase.

Task 3: When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
A Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.

Task 4: Hexadecimal printing
A Python script that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.

Task 5: 00...99
A Python script that prints numbers from 0 to 99, separated by commas and spaces.

Task 6: Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
A Python script that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

Task 7: islower
A Python function that checks if a given character is lowercase.

Task 8: To uppercase
A Python function that prints a string in uppercase.

Task 9: There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
A Python function that prints the last digit of a number.

Task 10: a + b
A Python function that adds two integers and returns the result.

Task 11: a ^ b
A Python function that computes a to the power of b and returns the value.

Task 12: Fizz Buzz
A Python function that prints numbers from 1 to 100, with specific replacements for multiples of 3, 5, or both.

Task 13: Insert in sorted linked list
A C function that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

Task 14: Smile in the mirror
A Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase.

Task 15: Remove at position
A Python function that creates a copy of a string, removing the character at a specified position.

Task 16: ByteCode -> Python #2
A Python function that replicates the functionality of given Python bytecode.

Requirements
Python scripts are to be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
C scripts are to be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
All files must end with a new line.
The first line of Python scripts should be #!/usr/bin/python3.
A README.md file must be present at the root of the project folder.
Code should follow the PEP 8 style guide (checked using pycodestyle version 2.8.*).
All files must be executable.
The length of the files will be tested using wc.
C header files must be include guarded.
No global variables are allowed in C scripts.
The prototypes of functions must be included in the header file.
No more than 5 functions are allowed per C file.
Usage
To test the Python scripts, execute them in the following manner:

bash
Copy code
./script_name.py
To compile and test the C scripts, use the provided test files and execute as follows:

bash
Copy code
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 test_file.c script_file.c -o output_name
./output_name
Make sure to replace script_name.py, test_file.c, script_file.c, and output_name with the appropriate file names.
