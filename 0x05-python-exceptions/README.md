# Project Title: 0x05. Python - Exceptions

## Overview
This project aims to explore Python's exception handling mechanisms through a series of tasks. By completing these tasks, you'll gain a better understanding of how to handle errors and exceptions in Python programming.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand why Python programming is powerful and versatile.
- Differentiate between errors and exceptions.
- Define exceptions and demonstrate how to utilize them.
- Identify scenarios where exceptions are necessary.
- Implement proper exception handling techniques.
- Explain the purpose of catching exceptions and how to do it effectively.
- Demonstrate how to raise built-in exceptions.
- Recognize situations requiring cleanup actions after an exception occurs.

## Requirements
- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpretation/Compilation:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- **Files End with New Line:** Yes
- **First Line of Files:** `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **README.md:** A mandatory file at the root of the project folder
- **Code Formatting:** Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.\*)
- **Executable Files:** All files must be executable
- **File Length Testing:** The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Tasks
1. **Safe list printing:** Write a function to print elements of a list safely.
2. **Safe printing of an integers list:** Write a function to safely print an integer.
3. **Print and count integers:** Write a function to print the first x elements of a list containing only integers.
4. **Integers division with debug:** Write a function to divide two integers and print the result.
5. **Divide a list:** Write a function to divide element by element two lists.
6. **Raise exception:** Write a function to raise a type exception.
7. **Raise a message:** Write a function to raise a name exception with a message.
8. **Safe integer print with error message:** Write a function to safely print an integer with error messages.
9. **Safe function:** Write a function to execute another function safely.
10. **ByteCode -> Python #4:** Write a Python function that performs the same operation as provided Python bytecode.
11. **CPython #2: PyFloatObject:** Create C functions to print information about Python lists, bytes, and float objects.
