Python More Data Structures
Welcome to the "Python More Data Structures" project! This project is designed to strengthen your understanding of advanced data structures in Python. By completing the tasks in this project, you'll gain practical experience with sets, dictionaries, and lists, as well as other concepts like lambda functions and map, reduce, and filter functions.

Learning Objectives
By participating in this project, you will achieve the following learning objectives:

Understand the advantages of Python programming.
Master the usage of sets and their common methods.
Work effectively with dictionaries and know when to choose them over lists or sets.
Learn how to iterate through sets and dictionaries.
Gain proficiency in lambda functions.
Implement and understand the applications of map, reduce, and filter functions.
Project Requirements
General
Editors: vi, vim, emacs.
All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
The first line of all files should be #!/usr/bin/python3.
A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
Code should adhere to pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
All files must be executable.
The length of your files will be tested using wc.
Getting Started
To start working on the project, clone the repository and use the provided test files to validate your implementations. Execute the scripts as follows:

bash
Copy code
./0-main.py
./1-main.py
# ... and so on
Ensure that the output matches the expected results.

Task Overview
