alx-higher_level_programming Repository
Welcome to the alx-higher_level_programming repository! This repository is dedicated to storing all Python projects and tasks undertaken during the Alx Software Engineering program. Below, you'll find an overview of the structure, guidelines, and information necessary for navigating through the projects.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized into project directories, each containing individual tasks and their corresponding solutions. The typical structure for each project directory is as follows:

bash
Copy code
/project_directory
│
├── task_1
│   ├── file_1.py
│   ├── file_2.py
│   └── ...
│
├── task_2
│   ├── file_a.py
│   ├── file_b.py
